You can view my website at https://madelinebartley.onrender.com

This is a website that I'm building to act as my portfolio. It will house some of my favorite projects and highlight some of the resources that each took, like progess updates, related photos and videos, and more. 

I'm still working on building out some of the features and adding certain projects, but it's officially deployed! This is the first site I've ever published, and I couldn't be more excited to show it off. Thanks for checking it out!
