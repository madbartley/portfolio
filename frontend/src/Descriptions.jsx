        Portfolio: "I started building this site to showcase some of my favorite projects. I really enjoy what I do, so I wanted to highlight my work with a fun, social-media-influenced design. While I'm still uploading content across the site, I'm so proud to see my vision coming to life! Tech stack: Django backend, React frontend, Axios and Django REST Framework for the API, Bootstrap.",
        Mobile: "Low Pressure is an app that tracks barometric pressure data and predicts weather conditions that may cause sinus headaches in individuals sensitive to changes in atmospheric pressure. I created this app to use for myself, because I suspected that my headaches were related to barometric pressure changes, but I wasn't sure which ones. I'm currently working on completing the UI, and have begun tracking the data to make predictions! Tech stack: Django, React Native, MySQL, Django REST Framework, Axios, Expo.",
